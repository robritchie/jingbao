Jing Bao is derived from the Chinese coin named Tong Bao and Tong Bao translates into English as "The treasure of the Emperor for the use of the people".
Jing Bao translates roughly as "Golden Treasure". 
In the 21st century this has been appropriated to represent a crypto currency forked from litecoin code. It was decided to use Litecoin code as a base due
